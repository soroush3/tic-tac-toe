# Tic-Tac-Toe (ReactJS App)

A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe to become familiar with React.

I followed this tutorial: <https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html>
to become familiar with react which resulted in the regular tic-tac-toe game.

I then went on and created the Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe version with the knowledge
from that tutorial.

My CSS and HTML abilities are still at a beginner level.

To run the application, clone or download it. Point your terminal to the root
directory and run 'npm start' (make sure you have node js installed).

The application will open up in your browser.
